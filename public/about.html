<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>My Career</h2>
<p>My name is Elvis Javier! A 29 Year old male from New Jersey. I currently have a Bachelors Degree in Information Technology from
  NJIT (New Jersey Institute of technology). <br>
  Currently employed full time at a Point of sale software company called <a href="https://www.visualretailplus.com/">Visual Retail Plus</a> where I work as a support technician
  with knowledge in SQL server and writting T-SQL commands. <br>I also focus on intergrations between our system and the ecommerce platform 
  Shopify so I do have some ideas of APIs and JSON struture. Most of my time at work I am either training new customers, providing demos of
  the software or writting T-SQL quries for our current accounts based on their needs.<br>
  I am looking to expand my knowledge and get more into programming. I am hoping to start with the basics of web development and 
  go from there. <br>Its a super exciting time for me and I hope these projects and my new found skills can lead to something better down
  the line in my career.

<h2>My Likes</h2>
<p>During my free time I enjoy watching TV, Playing Video Games and watching funny Tik toks.
  I own a PlayStation 5 and a Nintendo Switch. I also enjoy spending time outdoors so I am not a full home body. <br>
  As far as sports I enjoy tennis, soccer, and track and field/cross country.
  I used to run for my high school track team and it was one of the most rewarding times of my life. <br>Both for my health and my mind.
  I am hoping to get into running more soon.
